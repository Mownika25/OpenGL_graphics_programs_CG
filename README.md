# Computer Graphics Programs

As a part of my 7th semester course, the programs are updated here....

## How to run the files in Windows 10 :

download the files and use

```

pip install glfw
pip3 install pyopengl

```

then use 
```
python filename
``` 
to run and escape to exit the graphics window
